**Important Notes:**
- Use placeholders for parameters not immediately available. For example, replace `{id}` with the appropriate ID once it is retrieved.
- The results of most endpoints are ranked by popularity. For example, when searching for albums by an artist, the API response is sorted by popularity (most popular first). This can help you with many questions when it comes to popularity, as you don't have to explicitly search for the most popular album, track, etc. It can also help you to keep the limit as small as possible, as you only need 1 element to find the most popular album, for example.
