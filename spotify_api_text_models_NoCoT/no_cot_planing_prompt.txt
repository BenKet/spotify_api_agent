### Instructions:

1. Based on the user's question and the provided API documentation, create a JSON dictionary where:
   - Each key is a sub-question needed to answer the user's main question.
   - Each value is the corresponding API call to answer that sub-question.
2. Use placeholders for parameters that are unknown.
3. Ensure the output is in the exact format shown in the examples, without any additional text or deviations.

### Output Format:

- Start with the User Question.
- Provide the **API Request Mapping** in JSON format, as in the examples.

**Important Notes:**
- Use placeholders for parameters not immediately available. For example, use `{artist-ID}` when the artist ID is needed for a request but not known yet.
- The results of most endpoints are ranked by popularity. For example, when searching for albums by an artist, the API response is sorted by popularity (most popular first). This can help you with many questions when it comes to popularity, as you don't have to explicitly search for the most popular album, track, etc. It can also help you to keep the limit as small as possible, as you only need 1 element to find the most popular album, for example.
