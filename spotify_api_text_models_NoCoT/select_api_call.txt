Based on the following information:

**List of API Requests:**
{api_requests}

**Additional Information:**
{additional_info}

**Instructions:**
1. Identify the first API requests from the list that can be executed immediately (i.e., they contain no placeholders).
2. If none are executable as-is, identify the first API requests where placeholders can be filled using the additional information.
3. Replace any placeholders in the selected API requests with the corresponding values from the additional information.
4. **Output** a JSON object **mapping one question** to the **fully formed** (executable) API request.

Important:
- **Return only one valid JSON object** with one question as key and one final request as value.
- Return the **exact same API request (with filled placeholders, if existing)**. Do not change other parts of the API Request, exact the placeholders.
- **Do not include** any additional text, code fences, or explanations.
- If multiple API requests can be executed, return only the first executable API request.
- If none can be executed, **return an empty JSON object** (e.g. `{{}}`).
